<i><h2>Players On Waivers</h2></i>
<pre>
The following players are currently available on waivers.  Claims on players
are processed on the available date listed.  If more than one owner claims
a player, the player is awarded to that owner who has the highest waiver
precedence. Waiver precedence is determined by lowest winning percentage, on
a weekly basis.  At 12:01 PM, any player who went unclaimed is placed in the
free agent pool.  All free agents are available of a first come first serve basis.
