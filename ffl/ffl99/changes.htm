<CENTER><H2>Fantasy Football 1999 -- Proposed Rule Changes.</H2></CENTER>

<pre>
<li>For a 10 team league divide the $ 65,25,10%.  For a 12 team league divide it 50,25,15,10
<li>Any owner bitching about stupid shit is automatically removed from the league.
<li>Each team must draft at least one rookie.
<li>Close free agent roster moves during the playoffs.
<li>Eliminate the trading deadline, the Farmerie cluase is all we need.
<li>Add a toilet bowel game during week 16 (possibly a losers bracket as well).
<li>Pick the entire draft order before the draft.  This will allow for
  a more organized and faster draft.
<li>Review the starting lineup submital policy.  Can rosters be changed
  until kickoff of each game?
<li>Each team chooses a team name.
<li>Keep the roster size at 23, but at some point (maybe week 4?) cut 
  the rosters to ~20.
<li>Fumbles lost yield negative points.
<li>Reduce the roster size.
<li>Move the trading deadline to an earlier week in the season.
<li>Eliminate double (bonus) points.
<li>Modify bonus scoring to yield 1 pt for every 10 yards gained, and 1 pt per 25yds
  for QBs.
