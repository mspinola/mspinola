<CENTER><H2>Fantasy Football 1999 -- Trades.</H2></CENTER>

<pre>
Two or more owners may exchange players any time prior to the kickoff of the first
NFL game of week 10.  A trade becomes valid only after all parties involved have
contacted the commissioner and verified the terms of the deal and the trade survives
a three day review period.  The trade is executed at the end of this three day review
period.  During this review period a trade may be protested, at which time the trade 
is brought to a vote amongst owners. A simple majority overrules the trade.

<b>Erik Farmerie Clause</b>
Any team mathmatically eliminated from the playoffs may not trade.
