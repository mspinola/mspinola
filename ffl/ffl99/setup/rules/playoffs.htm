<pre>
All rules continue to apply, including those regarding waivers.  If two teams
tie in a playoff game, the team finishing with the better record in the regular
season advances.

Playoffs comence on NFL week 14, and finish on NFL week 16.

The three division winners advance to the playoffs, in addition to three wild
card teams.  The top two division winners, in regards to record, receive a first
round bye.  The third division winner plays the worst wild card team, while
the other two wild card teams compete in the first round.  The number one seeded
team plays the worst team still alive in round two, while the second division
winner plays the remaining team.  The winners of round two meet in the Super Bowl
which determines the champion.
