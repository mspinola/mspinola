<pre>
Players not on a 23-man roster are considered unrestricted free agents.  Unrestricted
free agents are available on a first-come, first-serve basis, and may be claimed at
any time.

Released players become restricted free agents, not available to any team until
the player appears on the weekly mailing as a waiver player.  Each team may extend 
dibs for players any time prior to the Friday 12 PM deadline each week.  Players
who are claimed by a fantasy owner prior to the deadline are awarded to the owner
based on the weekly calculated waiver precedence.  (Waiver precedence is described
below.)  Any player who remains unclaimed by a fantasy owner at the weekly deadline
automatically becomes a free agent.

Waiver precedence determines the priority of fantasy owner dibs on waiver players.
It is determined by listing all teams in order of losing percentage, with the tie-
breaker being the least amount of points.  The order is determined this way to 
provide the worst teams with the highest precedence and those better teams with
the lowest precedence.
