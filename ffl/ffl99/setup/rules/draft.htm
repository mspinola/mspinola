<pre>
The entry fee is due the day of the draft. Any owner not paid in full at the
start of a week automatically forfeits that week's game.

Each owner receives 17 draft selections, from which at most 2 QBs, 4 RBs,
5 WRs, 2 TEs, 2 Ks, and 2 DTs are drafted. At no point in the draft can an
owner have less than 15 draft selections.  In other words, an owner can trade
at most two draft selections before receiving one in return.

First and Second round selections allow two minutes per pick, while all other
draft selections allow one minute.

A draft order will be determined by a random drawing prior to every other
round excluding the 17th.  The 17th round implements the same order as the
15th round.

An optional supplemental draft will be held following the draft, lasting at
most 6 rounds.  Owners may withdraw from the supplemental draft at any time.
A supplemental draft order will be determined by a random drawing prior to 
the first round.  Subsequent rounds use the inverse order of the previous round.
