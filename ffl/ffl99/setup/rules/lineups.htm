<CENTER><H2>Fantasy Football 1999 -- Lineups.</H2></CENTER>

<pre>
Owners submit a starting lineup of exactly 1 quarterback, 2 running backs,
3 wide receivers, 1 tight end, 1 kicker, and 1 defense prior to 1:00 PM 
Sunday.  In the case of Thursday and Saturday games, all players to play
in these games must be declared before the repsected kickoff. If an owner
fails to submit a lineup by the deadline, it remains unchanged from the
prior week.  If the unchanged lineup rule doesn't apply, then the
commissioner shall determine the lineup (using the judgment of a reasonably
prudent person.)  The commissioner should make every effort to decide on
the lineup (in such rare cases) prior to the games.
