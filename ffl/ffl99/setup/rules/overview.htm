<pre>
This is a game of skill.  Winners will be determined by the objective criteria set
forth below.  The winners will be determined based on their ability to use their skill
and knowledge of the National Football League ("NFL") rules to accumulate the most
points during the term of the Fantasy Football '99 according to the rules set forth.

The league is comprised of three four team divisions.  Each owner will select a roster
of players, choose a starting lineup for each game of a 13 week regular season, and
perhaps sign replacement players or make trades.  At the end of the fantasy season
(week 14 of the NFL season) a playoff tournament will determine the league champion.
The league champion takes home 75% of the prize and the runner up receives 25%.
