<pre>
<h3>New Trade Policy</h3><ul>
<li>All accepted trades are subject to a three day review period.  The trade
is executed at the end of this three day review period.  During this review
period a trade may be protested, at which time the trade is brought to a
vote. A simple majority overrules the trade.

<li>Trades can occur threw the games of Week 10.

<li>Any team mathmatically eliminated from the playoffs may not trade (aka 
Erik Farmerie Clause).

</ul><p><p><h3>Draft Modifications</h3><ul>
<li>Each team receives 17 draft selections, from which at most 2 QBs, 4 RBs,
5 WRs, 2 TEs, 2 Ks, and 2 DTs are drafted.

<li>At no point in the draft can an owner have less than 15 draft selections.

<li>An optional supplemental draft will be held following the draft, lasting at
most 6 rounds.

</ul><p><p><h3>Scoring Changes</h3><ul>
<li>Individual players receive the standard 6, 9, and 12 points for punt and
kick returns resulting in a touchdown.  This scoring is not treated as
a bonus score.

<li>If a phantom team is used, then the phantom's point total for the week is
the median of all teams point scores for that week.

</ul><p><p><h3>Entry Fee</h3><ul>
<li>The entry fee for FFL 99 is $50.

<li>The entry fee is due the day of the draft. Any owner not paid in full at the
start of a week automatically forfeits that weeks game.

</ul><p><p><h3>Waiver System</h3><ul>
<li>Any player cut from a FFL roster is placed on waivers.

<li>A player remains on waivers for the current FFL week and becomes available
for pickup on the Saturday of the following week.

<li>Any owner is free to place a pickup claim for the player before the said
Saturday.  However, the owner with the highest waiver precedence (at the time
of the player being cut) is awarded the player.

<li>If no owner claims the player, then the player becomes a free agent.

<li>Waiver precedence is determined by listing owners by their winning percentage
(lowest points acts as a tie breaker). The lowest winning percentage is awarded
the highest waiver precedence, followed by owners ranked from the lowest winning
percentage to the highest.
