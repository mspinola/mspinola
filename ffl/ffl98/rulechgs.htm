<pre>
These are rule changes proposed during this years league.  If you
can think of any let me know and I'll list them.  

These changes will be considered in the offseason:
<ul>
We should actually enforce the Randy Folks clause, even if it's the
commisioner making the trade (ie your little deal with Farm earlier in the
season)

We should implement a new Erik Farmerie clause stating that teams that
have no fuck'n chance of making the playoffs should not be trading with
teams that are in the playoff hunt

We should reward teams more points for defensive TD's and kick returns,
especially 93 yard interception returns.  

Play two games per regular season week.

More points for individual players scoring special teams TDs.

$50 entry fee.

Matt automatically wins.

Phantom receives the median score rather than the average score per week.

Reduce the roster size from 23 to 20.

Salary stlye draft.

Some type of waiver system.

did most of those rule changes come from bitter owner who didn't 
make the playoffs?  I like the one about Matt wins everytime, how 
about Matt gets any trade or player he wants instead?  no way 50 
bucks, i'm fucking still in college man!  

Modify yardage bonuses for receivers, maybe 1 point for every 10 yds.

Reduce the amount of points given out.
</ul>
