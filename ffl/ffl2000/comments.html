Final Record: 46 - 35.
Year to date record: 45 - 34.

<A NAME="Week 16"></A>
<H2>Week Sixteen</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 46 - 34.

Crusaders vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- This is the matchup we've all been waiting for.  The Daddies won by 50 in week
    six, but this game should  be closer.  The Daddies hopes ride on Tampa Bay shutting
    down Faulk, but in the end it won't be enough.  The Crusaders will be parading
    down Mt. Royal Blvd Monday night.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 15"></A>
<H2>Week Fifteen</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 45 - 33.

Hoosier Daddies vs Boonie's Battalion
 -- Look for the Daddies to roll with Moss and company.

Crusaders vs Donations
 -- Grbac can't keep pace with Warner as the Donations pick up their
    second ever FFL playoff victory.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 14"></A>
<H2>Week Fourteen</H2>
<pre>
Final Regular Season Record: 43 - 33.

Farmerie's Farmers (8-5) vs Boonie's Battalion (7-5-1)
 -- For the second week in a row these two teams match up against each
    other.  The season record is split at 1-1.  Swami sees a close game
    brewing here, but thinks Robert Smith has been healthy for too long.
    With Smith going down this week, the Farmers won't be able to recover.

Millvale Maulers (8-5) vs Donations (8-5)
 -- The Maulers won the only matchup between these two teams this year.
    James isn't enough to hold off the Kurt Warners, there back baby!  The
    Donations in a romp of the Maulers pick up their first ever FFL playoff
    victory.

Bye Weeks:
Crusaders
Hoosier Daddies
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 13"></A>
<H2>Week Thirteen</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 37 - 33.

Horny Toads (5-6-1) vs Vicodins (3-8-1)
 -- The Toads are third overall in total points scored, but they'll be
    watching the playoffs from home.  Look for the Toads to take their
    frustration out on the lonely Vicodins.

Pabst Pounders (4-8) vs Hoosier Daddies (7-4-1)
 -- The Pounders are out to prove that they belong in the playoffs.  A
    Daddies win would all but lock up a first round bye.  Swami likes the
    Daddies to come through in the clutch.

Millvale Maulers (7-5) vs Arenth's Armada (4-8)
 -- A Maulers victory and a Daddies loss would give the Maulers the East 
    and hope at a first round bye.  The Maulers win big here.

Berez's Ball Busters (4-8) vs Donations (8-4)
 -- The Donations have clinched a playoff birth, and a win this week coupled
    with a Crusaders loss will give the Donations a much needed week off.
    Swamit thinks the Busts will play the spoiler this week.

Farmerie's Farmers (7-5) vs Boonie's Battalion (7-4-1)
 -- The winner of this game wins the Central division crown, and an outside
    shot at a bye week.  Game of the week, the Farmers will pull off a low
    scoring victory this week.

Nashville Texans (6-6) vs Crusaders (8-4)
 -- The Crusaders clinched a playoff birth and a win this week assures the
    Crusaders the West and a first round bye.   The Crusaders will leave the
    Texans wondering why Alstott never lived up to that third round pick status.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 12"></A>
<H2>Week Twelve</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 34 - 30.

Farmerie's Farmers (6-5) vs Horny Toads (5-5-1)
 -- With just two games to go this game has major playoff implications for the 
    Central.  Trent Green and the Toads have had this game circled on their
    calenders for weeks now.  In the end the Farmers hold on for a victory.

Millvale Maulers (7-4) vs Hoosier Daddies (6-4-1) 
 -- Another division showdown here.  The FFL must be loving what the parity
    is doing for the TV ratings.  The Swami likes the Daddies w/ Culpepper at
    the helm.

Pabst Pounders (3-8) vs Arenth's Armada (4-7)
 -- Only if the Pounders had a defense, they are fourth in the league with 861
    points scored but they've given up a league leading 912 points.  With or 
    without Owens the Pounders destroy the Armada.

Nashville Texans (6-5) vs Donations (7-4)
 -- A win here by the Donations just may assure the Donations their first
    playoff apppearance since 1996.  The Donations just don't have the firepower
    to win without Warner and Griese.

Vicodins (2-8-1) vs Boonie's Battalion (7-3-1)
 -- The Battalion still can't believe it lost the first game against the Vicodins.
    The Vicodins are an embarrassing 1-5-1 since that win and are 1-6 coming off a non-win.
    Swami says lay the points and ride the Battalion to the bank.

Crusaders (7-4) vs Berez's Ball Busters (4-7)
 -- The Crusaders have lost two in a row now, make that three as the Busts play the
    spoiler and knock of the Crusaders.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 11"></A>
<H2>Week Eleven</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 31 - 27.

Boonie's Battalion (6-3-1) vs Horny Toads (5-4-1)
 -- Game of the year in the central.  The Toads make it five in a row and take over
    sole possesion of first place.

Arenth's Armada (4-6) vs Hoosier Daddies (5-4-1) 
 -- The Armada needs this game to keep the playoff hopes alive.  The Daddies will win
    this game big, and have a good shot of taking over first place in the East.
     
Crusaders (7-3) vs Donations (6-4)
 -- This is a big game in the West, this may be the Donations last chance to prove
    that they belong.  Swami thinks the Crusaders will pull it off, even w/o Faulk's
    services.

Pabst Pounders (3-7) vs Millvale Maulers (6-4)
 -- The Pounders conceded the season last week only to take back the concession.  The
    Pounders are out to prove that they've been hosed.  Maulers suffer a major setback
    this week.

Farmerie's Farmers (5-5) vs Vicodins (2-7-1)
 -- The Vicodins are awful, even after last week's miracle victory. The embarasment
    continues.

Nashville Texans (6-4) vs Berez's Ball Busters (3-7)
 -- The Busts stay alive in the playoff hunt with Freddy Talyor finally performing
    to expectations.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 10"></A>
<H2>Week Ten</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 28 - 24.

Hoosier Daddies (5-3-1) vs Horny Toads (4-4-1)
 -- The Daddies make a respectable outing, but in the end the Toads prove to strong.

Millvale Maulers (5-4) vs Donations (6-3)
 -- The Kurt Warners ride Griese to a victory.

Nashville Texans (5-4) vs Pabst Pounders (3-6)
 -- The Pounders are the best 3-6 team in fantasy football history, but the Texans ride
    Alstot to a victory.

Vicodins (1-7-1) vs Arenth's Armada (4-5)
 -- Can the Vicodins regain respectability versus the lonely Armada?  Swami doesn't think
    so either.

Berez's Ball Busters (3-6) vs Boonie's Battalion (5-3-1)
 -- The Busts are down and out, but look for the Busts to crush the Kordell Stewart led
    Battalion.

Crusaders (7-2) vs Farmerie's Farmers (4-5)
 -- Upset special, Farmers romp the Crusaders.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 9"></A>
<H2>Week Nine</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 25 - 21.

Berez's Ball Busters (3-5) vs Horny Toads (3-4-1)
 -- The Busts have lost two straight, while the Toads have won two straight. Swami
    says this trend will continue.

Crusaders (6-2) vs Arenth's Armada (4-4)
 -- The Crusaders won't let bye weeks interfere with their stomping of the hapless
    Armada.

Vicodins (1-6-1) vs Millvale Maulers (4-4)
 -- The Maulers enjoy the week off as James outscores the pathetic Vicodins.  Insert
    your own Kitna/Huard and Vicodins joke here.

Boonie's Battalion (5-3) vs Hoosier Daddies (5-3)
 -- Can the Daddies make it six in a row?  Swami thinks so.

Pabst Pounders (3-5) vs Donations (Kurt Warners) (5-3)
 -- The Kurt Warners can't win w/o Warner, atleast not until Grease returns from the 
    bye.  Garcia lights up the Rams and the Warners.

Nashville Texans (4-4) vs Farmerie's Farmers (4-4)
 -- The Farmers are still smarting from last weeks lose to the Armada.  All indicators
    point to the Farmers in a cake walk.  Farmers are looking to force a 1st place tie
    w/ the Battalion in the Central.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 8"></A>
<H2>Week Eight</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 21 - 19.

Nashville Texans vs Horny Toads
 -- Is this the week Alstott plays like a third round pick, Swami doesn't think so
    either.  Toads make it two in a row.

Berez's Ball Busters vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- Since opening the season 0-3 the Daddies have rattled off four straight victories.
    Make that five in a row as Ricky and Emmitt turn the Busters into Busts.  And it
    doesn't get any easier for the Busts who draw the almost mighty Horny Toads next week.

Farmerie's Farmers vs Arenth's Armada
 -- The Farmers have won two in a row while the Armada has lost two in a row.  Farmers
    have more points from a single TE (55) than the Armada has from all of its RBs (33).
    Farmers take over sole possession of 1st place with an impressive 3 wins in a row.

Crusaders vs Millvale Maulers
 -- Can anyone or anything stop the Crusaders?  Short of a Faulk injury or Montana playing
    for Seattle in a Kitna jersey, Swami says it won't be the Maulers.

Boonie's Battalion vs Donations (Kurt Warners)
 -- What happened to these once promising teams, Swami likens it to the fall of the niners
    and the Cowboys.  Swami likes the Kurt Warners over the Battailion.

Pabst Pounders vs Vicodins
 -- The only thing more embarrassing than the Vicodins are the Armada (well maybe the Dogs too).
    The Vicodins are an impressive 1-0 when coming off 3 non-wins in a row, will the streak
    continue?  Swami likes the QBless (41 points from QBs) Pounders to roll in a laugher.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 7"></A>
<H2>Week Seven</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 18 - 16.

Donations vs Horny Toads
 -- The Toads' only hope is that Warner is pulled after the 1st quarter.  Donations roll.

Nashvile Texans vs Arenth's Armada
 -- Armada pulls off another cheesy win.

Crusaders vs Boonie's Battalion
 -- Crusaders show the Battalion why the West is the best division in fantasy.

Vicodins vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- Daddies pummel the Vicodins, and kick 'em while they're down.

Berez's Ball Busters vs Millvale Maulers
 -- Swami's working his voodoo magic, taking the Maulers to win.  (Maulers are 0-2 when choosen
    by the Swami.)

Farmerie's Farmers vs Pabst Pounders
 -- Farmers will be first in the Central come Tuesday night.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 6"></A>
<H2>Week Six</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 14 - 14.

Pabst Pounders vs Horny Toads
 -- Toads suffer another tough lose.

Donations vs Arenth's Armada
 -- Kurt who?  Donations prove they can win without Warner.

Nashvile Texans vs Boonie's Battalion
 -- Battalions continue to roll.

Crusaders vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- Daddies pull off a low scoring victory.

Farmerie's Farmers vs Millvale Maulers
 -- Farmers gleefully continue the Mauler's slide.

Berez's Ball Busters vs Vicodins
 -- Swami learned his lesson, the Ball Buster's can score.  Take the Vicodins anyway.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 5"></A>
<H2>Week Five</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 12 - 10.

Millvale Maulers vs Arenth's Armada
 -- Swami wants to know how the Armada has two victories?  Take the Maulers laying the 21 1/2.

Farmerie's Farmers vs Boonie's Battalion
 -- The Battalion begins to pull away from the pack in the Central.

Vicodins vs Horny Toads
 -- Toads roll to make it two in a row.

Pabst Pounders vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- After a strong QB outing last week, the Pounders QBs have -2 for the year.  Moss and company
    warm up for a week five Daddies romp.

Berez's Ball Busters vs Donations
 -- Hey, tell the Ball Busters that this isn't golf, the lowest scoring team doesn't win.  Donations
    continue the Cinderella season.  A win by the Donations would most likely land the 14th nationally ranked
    Donations into the top 10.

Crusaders vs Nashvile Texans
 -- Upset special, Texans over the Crusaders.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 4"></A>
<H2>Week Four</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 10 - 7.

Farmerie's Farmers vs Horny Toads
 -- Still love those Farmers.

Millvale Maulers vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- Maulers make it four in a row. 

Pabst Pounders vs Arenth's Armada
 -- The Pounders have a combined -14 points from their QBs, take the Pounders anyway. 

Vicodins vs Boonie's Battalion
 -- Vicodins bring the Battalion back to reality, ecking out their first victory.
 
Crusaders vs Berez's Ball Busters
 -- The return of Fred Taylor inspires the Ball Busters to an upset victory.
</pre>

<A NAME="Week 3"></A>
<H2>Week Three</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 6 - 5.

Crusaders vs Donations
 -- Are these Donations for real? Can the Donations possibly go 3 - 0?
    Swami always loved Cinderela!  Donations keep the storybook season alive.

Arenth's Armada vs Hoosier Daddies
 -- The Daddies love these easy division games; Daddies loosing streak ends at two.

Boonie's Battalion vs Horny Toads
 -- Swami thinks Kordell looks prime against the Brownies, but still takes the Toads in this must win game.

Pabst Pounders vs Millvale Maulers
 -- Swami loves easy wins, and a good chuckle.  Whose offense is more inept, Pounders wk 3 lineup or the Steelers?

Farmerie's Farmers vs Vicodins
 -- With a name like Farmers, how can you not win? (Even without a friggin QB!)

Nashville Texans vs Berez's Ball Busters
 -- Looks like Shaun King is willing to play QB in Texas and Bust Berez's Balls.
</pre>
<br>

<A NAME="Week 2"></A>
<H2>Week Two</H2>
<pre>
Year to date record: 3 - 3.

Farmers vs Daddies
 -- Swami still likes the Farmers.

Crusaders vs Toads
 -- Swami says don't believe the hype, the Crusaders suffer a week two let down.

Battalion vs Armada
 -- Look for the Armada to pull out another low scoring victory.

Texans vs Maulers
 -- Even with Kitna at the helm the Maulers will make it two in a row.
  
Ball Buster's vs Pounders
 -- Ball Buster's will pull away in this matchup of the offensive juagernauts.
</pre>
<br>

<A NAME="Week 1"></A>
<H2>Week One</H2>
<pre>
Swami says he never seen a mall in Millvale; down goes the Millvale Maulers.

Even Alstott can't carry the Nashvile Texans past the Daddies.

Swami likes Armada's chances vs a Taylor less Ball Busters.

With a name like Farmers, how can you loose?  You can't, take the Farmers.

Swami goes retro and takes the Pabst Pounders.  Does anyone still drink Pabst?

Take the Crusaders this week.  Why?  Swami says WHY NOT?
