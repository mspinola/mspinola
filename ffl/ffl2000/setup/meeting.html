FFL 2000
Office of the Commissioner
1915 Jane Street
Pittsburgh, PA 15203



Fellow FFL owners,

The Commissioner's Office would like to welcome FFL owners to another year of fantasy
football.  We are about to embark on our tenth fantasy season.  This year will also 
mark the inaugural season for the Premiere Dynasty League (PDL).  League info can be
found at www.fflreport.com.
 
PDL is open to existing FFL owners as well as other invitees.  FFL and PDL differ in
that PDL owners have the option of retaining players from year to year.  Also PDL
division structure remains constant from year to year.
 
In an attempt to prepare for the upcoming season, an organizational meeting has been
scheduled for the evening of Thursday July 27.  This will take place at the Mount 
Royal Inn, around 8 PM.

Besides getting drunk, the purpose of this meeting is to discuss any rule modifications
owners may have.  Enclosed, you will find a set of rules for both FFL and PDL.

Tentatively, the dynasty league draft is scheduled for Saturday August 5, and the FFL
draft is scheduled for the evening of Saturday August 19.  Please contact the
<a href="mailto:comish@fflreport.com">commissioner</a> as soon as possible to confirm draft dates and the meeting date.

I can be reached at 431-2083 (home), 999-4457 (cell), 688-2512 (work), and via email
at comish@fflreport.com.
