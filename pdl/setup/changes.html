<H2>Changes to be voted on at the PDL 2020 Summer Meeting.</H2>
Instead of unalignment or even having divisions what if we do one of the following:
1) Everyone plays each other once (weeks 1 thru 15).  Top 2 teams play each other in the championship week 16.  Bottom 2 teams play for the TB.
2) We each play 13 of the 15 teams and start the playoffs week 14 like we do today.  Top 8 teams are in.  Bottom 8 play for the TB.

2018 Draft
The desire was to push the draft back closer to the start of the NFL season. Additionally, both Casye's and the E-Town are closed August 6. The other date everyone appeared to be available was Tuesday September 4. This is the day after Labor Day. Unless someone has a strong objection I'd like to move the draft to Sep-4 at Casey's (6:30 arrival with a 7 pm start).

New Owner
So long Phil. Thanks for the memories! I'm pretty sure Kevin Cardone will be stepping in as the new owner of Bunchalosers. He will assume ownership upon his confirmation of acceptance. He is free to rebrand the franchise as desired (name, logo, etc). Kevin is included on this email. I will arrange transfer of login info.

Promotions
Rich Raida has been named the VP of Drafting. He will assume responsibility for coordinating the draft. This includes collecting availability, picking a date, and choosing a location. Thanks Rich!

Mike Spinola has been named the VP of Summer Meetings. He will assume responsibility for coordinating the summer meeting. This includes scheduling and selection of a location. Thanks Mike!

Rule Changes Discussed
Several changes were discussed. A few that were deemed to have minimal overall impact were voted on by the 6 franchises in attendance. These changes will take effect immediately. There were a couple broader reaching changes that we will extend to a league vote. Please provide a yea or nay for the three issues listed below.

Last Night Votes
1. Dropping retainments from 12 to 8 was discussed but never moved to a vote for obvious reasons.
2. Reducing 1 point / 10 yards threshold for rushing/receiving from 50 yards to 0 and passing from 200 to 0. This change was adopted. 
All players will score:
    * 1 point per 10 yards rushing
    * 1 point per 10 yards receiving
    * 1 point per 20 yards passing 
3. Award fractional points for yardage based scoring. This change was adopted. This effectively changes the yardage scoring to the following:
    * 0.1 point per 1 yard rushing
    * 0.1 point per 1 yars receiving
    * 0.1 point per 2 yards passing
4. Add a bracket to kicker scoring. This change was adopted. Kickers will now score as follows:
   * 0 - 39 yards 3 points
   * 40 - 49 yards 5 points
   * 50 -59 yards 7 points
   * 60+ 10 points

Topics to put to a league vote
Polls are created at the MFL website. Voting is open until 9am Aug 2.
1. Award 0.5 point per reception.
2. Turn the 3rd WR spot into a flex (RB, WR, or TE)
3. Add a flex spot (ie 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 Flex, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 D)

The default date for future drafts will be the Tuesday after labor day. If the NFL resumes scheduling week 1 games prior to labor day then we'll move the draft back accordingly. Mark your calendars!

<UL><LI>line ups</LI></UL>
<ol>There has been talk of starting lineups being set, um, say less than ideal or not set at all. Our current rules copy the previous week's lineup to the current week's lineup each Tuesday. This ensures everyone has a starting lineup whether they submit one or not. Each owner is free to change that lineup as they see fit.

There is another option to instead of simply copying the previous week's line up, it instead chooses a lineup based on FantasySharks.com's weekly player ratings. This would result in a much better lineup for any team forgetting to submit a lineup. This would also eliminate the situation where a top player is left on the bench because they were on a bye the previous week or starting a player on a bye.

<OL>No</OL>

<UL><LI>Trophy</LI></UL>
<OL>The trophy is down to its last name plate. As its been on my todo list for the past few years, I'm going to find some blank name plates to order on the web. We can continue using the same trophy and just add these plates where room allows. There will be a small charge this year for the name plates (maybe $2 per owner).</OL>

<UL><LI>Tie Breaker</LI></UL>
<OL>This sparked a larger discussion about a balanced schedule and realignment. In the end, the tie breaker was modified to include head-to-head matchups as first tie-breaker. When 2 teams tie, the tie will now be broken based on their head to head result. If 3 or more teams are tied, the head-to-head tie breaker is skipped (resulting in breaking the tie by points).

1. Head to head record (skipped if 3 or more teams are tied)
2. Points
3. Coin toss</OL>

<UL><LI>Balanced Schedule</LI></UL>
<OL>This was voted down. Preference was to realign instead of balancing the schedule.</OL>

<UL><LI>Realignment</LI></UL>
<OL>Realignment passed. New divisions picked at this year's draft (August 26) and will go into effect for the PDL 2015 season. Realignment will occur in this fashion every 5 years. Each owner, at the time of their original first round draft pick, will pick a division out of a hat.</OL>

<UL><LI>Anti-Tanking</LI></UL>
<OL>Owners finishing the season in the bottom eight of the league (i.e. non-playoff teams) will have their draft position set by potential points (instead of head-to-head record). Potential points are calculated by the myfantasyleague.com website. These points equal the season point total as if the franchise started its optimal lineup each week. This addresses the tanking issue by not basing draft position on the franchise's starting lineup points/head-to-head results. Rather draft position is based on the points that franchise could have scored.</OL>

<UL><LI>Toilet Bowl</LI></UL>
<OL>A toilet bowl playoff for the non-playoff teams was suggested and agreed to. The bottom 8 will play in a playoff format during weeks 14-16. Winner will have next season's entry fee paid by the remaining owners ($4 per owner starting next season).</OL>

<UL><li>supplemental draft</li></ul>
<ol>Each team places a secret bid (via email) on any player taken in the NFL supplemental draft and the highest bid wins. In other words, 
if someone places a second round bid on Terrelle Pryor/Josh Gordon and nobody else bids on him, that team will lose their 2013 second 
round pick and be awarded the rights to him. Tie-breaker for multiple teams who place bids for the same round -- player is awarded to 
the team with the worst record from the previous year.</ol>
<ol>No, this was deemed unnecessary</ol>

<UL><LI>pick ups</LI></UL>
<OL>I think there is a potential flaw in the waiver wire system. An owner can acquire and release every player in the same week thus 
locking every player from being picked up during the free claim period. I think that if a player is claimed they either need to be 
held until waivers for the next week. Or players added and dropped in the same waiver wire period they were added are not locked when dropped.</OL>
<OL>The preference was to make a picked up player stay on a roster for a minimum of 1 week. The software doesn't support this, so the rules stay as they are.</OL>

<pre>
Eliminate the scheduling of division opponents twice per season. That way teams get to play 13 different opponents during the regular season

Yes, with modifications to schedule and draft format as noted below. Note this passed 3 votes to 2 (Yays: Keenan, Kraus, Raida; Nays: Hatok, Spinola)

Overview of changes:
The 2013 season and draft will remain in it's current format with the division winners and 2 wild cards per conference making the playoffs.
Starting in 2014 divisions and conferences will be scrapped entirely.  The top 14 teams will now be in a division called "A Flight" and will be able to compete for the PDL championship.
The 2 teams with the worst record are relegated to a new division called the "B Flight" and will not be able to participate in the 2014 season.
League will continue to be in a "head to head" format, but all tie-breakers start with total points scored.
The changes when implemented will ensure schedule, draft, and competitive balance fairness for all PDL teams.
 
Changes specific to "A Flight"
"A Flight" schedule going forward will be to play everyone else in "A Flight" once during the regular season in head to head format. 
The top 8 teams based on win/loss record qualify for the playoffs with a 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5 playoff matchup.
After each round of the playoffs the winning teams are re-seeded so the highest remaining seed will always play the lowest remaining seed until a champion is crowned.
 
Changes specific to "B Flight"
The two teams who finish 13th and 14th in A Flight are relegated to B Flight for the 2015 season and will not be able to compete for the PDL championship.
The 2 teams in B Flight are brought back into A Flight for the 2015 season.
 
Draft changes:
Playoff teams draft order will be decided upon reverse order of elimination (i.e., champ drafts 16, runner-up 15, losers in the semi-finals 14 & 13, losers in the first round 12-9.
Non-playoff teams will enter a draft lottery based on record and will all have a chance of obtaining the first overall pick.  The team that finished last will have 8 chances to win the first pick, next to last 7 chances, and so on.

<H2>Changes to be voted on at the PDL 2008 Summer Meeting.</H2>

<ul><li> make the pool of players from which the retainment values are set include the 
QBs, RBs, and WRs, cumulative, and then increase the number of players that cost 3 
retainments to 15, players that cost 2 retainments to 40.  Keep the TEs, Ks, DTs 
individualized.</ul>								
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<ul><li>Reduce roster size to 17</ul>
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>If someone is playing Thursday (say Farve) and you don't put him in your lineup 
by his kickoff then you lose the right to start that player.  you could still start 
a qb playing sunday as long as you put the sunday qb in before sunday kickoff.  i 
think where our pdl rules have a loop hole is you could not put a lineup in for 
thursday.  if the thursday players suck, you could put new guys in for sunday.... 
but (here's the loophole) if the thursday guys did well you could not enter a lineup 
at all.  if no lineup is entered for sunday kickoff I as the comish just hit a buton 
to say "use last week's lineup"... this would let you kind of cheat w/ the thursday 
game players
<br><p>
One suggestion to correct this is:<br>
I think if a roster isn't set before the early games, then any players in those games 
should have their lineup status frozen when those games start.  So in this case, Favre 
should have been locked in as a starter as soon as the thursday night game started.  
Any players who were benched the previous week should have been locked in as being benched.  
I don't know if Statsworld has an option for this, but it seems like the best way to 
handle the situation. 
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>Need to make a rule to handle two or more players finishing tied for a retainment slot.  For
example, if the #3 and #4 RBs have the same number of points.
</ul>
<b><ol>Players tie for the higher slot.  This means there can be more than 3 top tier RBs, QBs, WRs, etc.</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>Increase retainment value of top 2 players (regardless of position) to 4
</ul>
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>Lower retainment slots
</ul>
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>Change no trade period from week 10 trade deadline to the close of the PDL Super Bowl (currently the resumption date is the NFL Pro Bowl)
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>Currently waivers are processed Friday mornings (and Thursday mornings when there is a Thursday night game).  After the weekly processing finishes, pickups can't happen until the following week.  This means that on Sunday morning when someone realizes that their kicker is on a bye that they can't go to the waiver wire and pick up a fill-in.  The only option (as it stands now) would be to put a claim in for the guy and wait until the following Friday to see if you get him.<BR><P>

The purpose of putting a player on waivers (as opposed to first come first serve) was to give all owners the oppurtunity to see who was dropped.  The system we use now was in place mainly due to limitations of the website (and comishioner lazyness).  The website now offers for some customization of this.<BR></BR><P>

Players are on waivers until Friday morning.  After waivers are processed all players (except those just dropped) become free agents that can be picked up on a first come first serve basis.  Those free agents are locked (on waivers once their game starts).  As an example, team a claims Player A and drops Player B on Friday during waivers.  Player B will be locked (on waivers) until the following Friday when waivers are processed again.  Player C who wasn't involved in any transactions of Friday will be available for pickup on a first come first served basis until Player C's game begins (say Sunday 1 pm).  Any player not picked up at game time will be put on waivers.

<H2>Changes to be voted on at the PDL 2006 Summer Meeting.</H2>

<UL>
<li>
Update rule regarding forfeit (for not paying on time) to allow other team to still lose.  Have the team playing the forfeited team play against the league average points scored for the week.
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes</ol></b>

<UL>
<li>
My first proposal is to limit the # of retainment slots to 10.  I would propose future reduction to 8, or even 6, but I think we should try 10 first (instead of 12).  Otherwise, the draft is too boring, and honestly, that traditionally was the best part of fantasy (except for when Tony-Buddy took the championship the one year).
</ul>
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<UL>
<li>
My second proposal, which can be in conjunction with the first, or totally separate, is to eliminate a 1st round pick if you retain a player that is top-3 or superstar or whatever the highest classification is.  I would say that this should only apply to retaining a top 3 QB or RB, but we could also consider the WR position (I don't think doing it for TEs, Ks, DTs is too attractive).
</ul>
<b><ol>No</ol></b>

<UL>
<li>
A rule was proposed to allow trades utilizing conditional draft picks.
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes -- the details of the conditions will be outlined on the PDL Trade History Website.</ol></b>

<UL>
<li>
Trophy handoff & engraving was proposed to change the procedure so that the current year winner retrieves the trophy from the previous year winner and the current year winner is also responsible for engraving the trophy.

A State of the League Recap (of the Summer Meeting) will be supplied by the Comish before the Annual Draft.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
A new rule was implemented that requires each owner to supply the comish with any date between July 4th and the start of the NFL season that the owner would not be able to draft.  This draft availability must be submitted with the retainments by July 4th of each off season.  The draft will be scheduled based on the information obtained (any owner not submitting draft availability will be assumed to be available on all dates.).  This rule will take affect for (next season) July 4th, 2006.

<A NAME="2003"></A>
<H2>Changes voted on at the PDL 2004 Summer Meeting.</H2>

<UL>
<li>
I have another rule change proposal, and here it is - eliminate ties.  Ties are dumb,<BR>
and I personally would feel ashamed if I ever had a tie next to my win/loss column.<BR>
The purpose of head to head competition in the first place is to determine who is<BR>
better at something, not who is equal.  I would love to hear valid reasons why there<BR>
should be ties during the season other than due to a math technicality "team x"<BR>
benefited from the tie(s) and made the post season.  However, I believe there is no<BR>
valid reasons for ties therefore they should be eliminated.<BR>
<BR>
I purpose that if two teams tie then the team that has the highest point<BR>
total for an individual player/defense should be declared the winner.  For<BR>
instance, if the Moose and HTrain play one another and the overall point<BR>
total is tied, we would compare your highest point scorer for the week<BR>
(Culpepper - 33) vs. my highest point scorer for that week (Jamal Lewis -<BR>
17).  You would be declared the winner because Culpepper scored more points<BR>
than Jamal Lewis.  If the top point scorers area are also tied, then move on<BR>
to the next highest scoring player on each team and so on.  I think this<BR>
would be more fair than designating a home and away team and awarding the<BR>
home team the win.<BR>
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes -- this rule passed</ol></b>
<ul>
<li>
A tiebreaker is needed for the Super Bowl.  It's possible the game could end in a tie.<BR>
</ul>
<b><ol>Yes -- this rule passed (using the method described above)</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>
I would like to see a rule change that allows us to pick up free agents after<BR>
the waiver deadline on Friday mornings (like I've bitched about in the past).<BR>
Sometimes a player will go from 'probable' to 'out' on Saturday and then you<BR>
are pretty much screwed.
</ul>
<b><ol>No -- this rule did not pass</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>
Modify our lottery system by only dropping the last place team to 3rd or 4th pick overall.
</ul>
<b><ol>No -- this rule did not pass</ol></b>

<ul>
<li>
After much debate it was decided to remove the lottery system for the annual draft.  The idea<BR>
of the lottery system was to prevent a team from tanking.  It was felt (by the owners in <BR>
attendance) that tanking could be better addressed.  The main problem is a team that is<BR>
not tanking who finish last or close to last in the overall standings stands a chance to<BR>
significantly fall in draft order based on the lottery picks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tanking is now being addressed as follows:</B><BR>
<li>
Any owner may bring a suspect situation to the attention of the comish.<BR>
<li>The comish will consider the complaint to decide if the situation warrants further<BR>
investigation by the governing board.  (The comish will take in to account all conditions<BR>
such as player matchups, win lose records, an owners position in regards to the draft, etc).
<li>The governing board will hear the facts of the situation and decide whether or not<BR>
the infracting owner is indeed tanking.<BR>
<li>An owner deemed to be tanking by the governing board will automatically have his<BR>
1st round draft pick (of the next draft) as the last pick.  If a 2nd infraction occurs<BR>
the 2nd round draft pick will be moved to the last pick of the 2nd round,... etc<BR>

<H2>Changes voted on at the PDL 2003 Summer Meeting.</H2>

<UL>
<li>
<pre>
I would like to bring up something that I would like discussed at the summer
meeting about a rule change.  Let's call it the Mike Brown proposal.  Yeah,
it's kind of funny to see a team with all second and third string
quarterbacks as the only quarterbacks on that team's respective roster, or
another team's only kicker was cut from the NFL team after week 2, and yes
players do get injured from time to time.  But dropping the only kicker you
have to pick up another player while not picking up another kicker is ULTRA
BUSH.   Why reward a team with an excellent draft position because they
tanked their season on purpose?  So they have handed to them the top player
available in that draft?  That's a load of crap.  I thought this league was
supposed to be about respect and integrity?   It's not impossible to rebuild
and still field a team of NFL players.  My proposal is this:

1)	Install a lottery system for the teams with the 5 worst records (or
even better for all of the teams that did not qualify for the playoffs) to
determine draft order, with playoff teams seeded as they have been in the
past.
<ol>Yes</ol>
A lottery system will be implemented for the 2004 draft.  Eligible for
the lottery will be the 8 non-playoff teams.  The last place team receives
8 lottery entries, 2nd to last place team receives 7 lottery entries, up to
the 8th worst team that recieves 1 lottery entry.  The entries will be drawn
from a hat to determine the draft order for picks 1 through 8.

2)	Raise the entry fee from $25 to an amount that someone would not
waste a year and everyone's time and effort by tanking on purpose.  
<ol>No</ol>

I think the lottery system would better deter ULTRA BUSH tactics in the
future.  Sorry to be so long winded about it, but this is something I feel
pretty strongly about.  Let me know what you think as well.

I have a few problems with the lottery system and raising the fee.  it
doesn't make a distinction between teams that are truly losing, and those
that tank games to improve draft position.  I'll use my team as an example.
Last year, there was a couple week strtch, when Hasselbeck and Mathews were
both benched, where I didn't have a QB that was starting.  there were no
starting QB in free agency at the time.  my only option was to trade, and of
course, since I was in a bad position, I'm not going to get good value in a
trade.  I recall being offered Dilfer for draft picks.  my thinking is why
should I have to sacrifice my future team, just to feild a starting QB (who
probably wouldn't even finish the season as a starter!)

I vote for the top 3 TE's to be worth 2pts rather than the top 5 TE's
<ol>Yes, starting after the 2003 season.</ol>

we draft the normal 21 or 22, whatever it is we draft, but we 
NEED to have 2 kickers and 2 defenses the whole season. then 
after that, you can pick what you want. i just think the people 
that only take one kicker and defense, with the purpose of 
dropping when they are on bye week is bull.
<ol>Yes, but modified.  All teams must have a roster that contains
at a starting lineup (1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def)</ol>

there should be a way to pick up a player between Friday and Sunday.  
Especially for kickers.  The way it is now, if you put in a claim on a
player and somebody else gets that player you are screwed. 
Even if it is just for people who have that happen, I think
you should be able to pick up a player after the waiver deadline.
<ol>Yes, this may be fixed by going to the online statsworld.com website.
We'll see what happens.</ol>
